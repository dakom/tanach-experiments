encode each channel (rgba) for letter (each pixel has 4 letters)

filter that highlights matches - can run over video, maybe each word in Tanach has color/alpha preset for match hit

maybe per-word (empty channel separator)

or per-passuk (empty pixel separator)


can make generic for any text-based filter
